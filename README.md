Collection of themes created for GIMP 2.10


Install
===


Copy the theme folders to the locations here depending on your OS :  

Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.10/themes   or   ~/.gimp-2.10/themes  

  * (You may have to unhide the Library folder first)  

Linux: ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/themes  

Windows: C:\Users\your_user_name\\.config\GIMP\2.10\themes  

(For the development version use 2.9 as the user settings directory)  


Notes
===

  * For this theme to work under KDE users will need to disable either "Apply colors to non-QT applications" or "Apply KDE Colours to Non-KDE apps" depending on the version.

  * Fonts can be overridden by uncommenting the two font lines in the theme gtkrc file.

  * "The Dark Side of Gimp" and "The Light Side of Gimp" are included with Gimp but the files are forked from this version.
  
  * Make the toolbar icons smaller by add the line after the colon to the beginning of the gtkrc file for the desired theme : gtk-icon-sizes = "gtk-small-toolbar=16,16:gtk-large-toolbar=16,16"
